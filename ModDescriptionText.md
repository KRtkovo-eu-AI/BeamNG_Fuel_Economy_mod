## ‚õΩ Fuel Price Configuration

To enable cost calculations:

- Use the in-game **Fuel Price Editor** dialog to set the values directly.  
- Set the Electricity, Gasoline or other fuel type values to the prices of fuel per volume unit you use (L or gal for liquid, kWh for electricity).  
- Optionally set a custom currency label (e.g. `$`, `‚Ç¨`).
