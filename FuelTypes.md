# Fuel Types

This document lists all fuel types recognized by the mod together with their CO₂ and NOₓ emission factors (in grams per liter).

| Fuel Type | Description | CO₂ (g/L) | NOₓ (g/L) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Gasoline | Conventional petrol for spark-ignition engines. | 2392 | 10 |
| Diesel | Common fuel for compression-ignition engines. | 2640 | 20 |
| LPG/CNG | Liquefied petroleum or compressed natural gas. | 1660 | 7 |
| Electricity | Electric energy used by fully electric drivetrains. | 0 | 0 |
| Air | Compressed air propulsion with negligible emissions. | 0 | 0 |
| Ethanol | Biomass-derived alcohol fuel. | 1510 | 3 |
| Hydrogen | CO₂-free fuel. Fuel cells emit no NOₓ, while combustion engines produce small amounts (~1 g/L). | 0 | 1 |
| Nitromethane / Nitromethan | High-performance drag racing fuel. | 820 | 12 |
| Food | Human metabolic energy used for novelty vehicles. | 0.001 | 0 |
| Kerosene / Jet Fuel | Used by turbines and jet engines in aircraft-style or experimental cars. | 2500 | 15 |
| Methanol | Motorsport fuel with high octane but lower energy per liter; distinct from ethanol. | 1100 | 4 |
| Biodiesel | Cleaner diesel alternative with different consumption and emissions. | 2500 | 18 |
| Synthetic fuels | CO₂ + hydrogen creating synthetic gasoline/diesel; promising future option. | 2392 | 10 |
| Coal Gas / Producer Gas | Historical wartime substitute for gasoline in vintage vehicles. | 2000 | 15 |
| Steam | External boiler providing steam power; steam itself carries no emissions. | 0 | 0 |
| Ammonia | Experimental carbon-free fuel that burns in engines. | 0 | 6 |
| Hybrid / Plug-in Hybrid | Combination of gasoline and electricity in one drivetrain. | 2392 | 10 |
| Fuel Oil / Heavy Oil | Very dirty fuel used in ships and old heavy machinery. | 3100 | 25 |
| Hydrazine / Hypergolic | Aggressive rocket propellants for extreme experiments. | 0 | 30 |
| Solid Rocket / Black Powder / ACPC | Solid rocket propellants such as black powder or AP composite. | 1900 | 20 |
